# Discount_Evaluation

This is a simple script to test logic in python. 

Create a program that determines if a person is eligible for a specific discount at a store. The discount criteria are as follows:

The person must be either a senior citizen (age 65 or older) or a student.
The total purchase amount must be more than $50.
If today is Tuesday, there's an additional 5% discount for everyone.
Write a program that takes three inputs: age, student status (True/False), total purchase amount, and whether today is Tuesday (True/False). The program should output whether the person is eligible for the discount and the final price after any additional Tuesday discount.
